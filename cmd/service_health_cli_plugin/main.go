// strings. args[0] will be the name of the command, and will be followed by
// any additional arguments a cli user typed in.

// user facing errors). The CLI will exit 0 if the plugin exits 0 and will exit

// during uninstall otherwise the name will be treated as seperate arguments.
// The second value is a slice of Command structs. Our slice only contains one
// Command Struct, but could contain any number of them. The first field Name
// defines the command `cf basic-plugin-command` once installed into the CLI. The
// second field, HelpText, is used by the core CLI to display help information
// to the user in the core commands `cf help`, `cf`, or `cf -h`.
